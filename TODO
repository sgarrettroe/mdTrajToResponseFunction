In this revamp here is what I want to do

OK 1a) mdTrajToFreq : redo the input arguments using get
long opt so that I can get options in and out more easily

1b) freqTrajToR5 : redo the input arguments using get
long opt so that I can get options in and out more easily

OK 2) mdTrajToFreq: be able to read in a mapping from forces / coords in
a general way so that I can try skinner's or phil's or anybody else's
mapping. And switch between OH and OD in a simple way rather than this
ugly by hand way.

OK 3) mdTrajToFreq: be able to output dipole moment and frequency for
ground and excited states

3) freqTrajToR5: update the way the calculation is done to be able to
inclde the noncondon effects and dependence of anharmonicity on
frequency

OK 4) move headers and helper functions into separate files (?)

5) mdFreqTraj : scaling of force to freq is probably wrong, only 60 cm-1 fwhm for whatever random water model I found. Rerun SPC/e to be sure

OK 6) mdTrajToFreq : test compression output

7) freqTrajToR5 : read compressed input

OK 8) mdTrajToFreq : read compressed input

OK 9) mdTrajToFreq: get rid of fixed width buffers

10) freqTrajToR5 : get rid of fixed width buffers
