In this revamp here is what I want to do

1) mdTrajToFreq and freqTrajToR5: redo the input arguments using get
long opt so that I can get options in and out more easily

2) mdTrajToFreq: be able to read in a mapping from forces / coords in
a general way so that I can try skinner's or phil's or anybody else's
mapping. And switch between OH and OD in a simple way rather than this
ugly by hand way.

3) mdTrajToFreq: be able to output dipole moment and frequency for
ground and excited states

3) freqTrajToR5: update the way the calculation is done to be able to
inclde the noncondon effects and dependence of anharmonicity on
frequency
